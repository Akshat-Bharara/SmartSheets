# SmartSheets
Created an Attendance Monitoring System that uses Face recognition.
This is a python project that uses the streamlit module to create an appealing UI.
The vision is to simplify the process of taking attendance manually as it is a tedious task and is prone to errors.
The features include: 
-> Attendance monitoring using face recognition
-> An attendance csv file is created for each day
-> The attendance data can be viewed visually in the form of bar graphs and pie charts
-> After the attendance is taken, an email notification is also sent.
